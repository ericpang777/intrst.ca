            <p>Has the idea of growing your money ever sparked INTRST in you? Do you wish to earn additional benefits on the money you currently have? If so, investing is the perfect solution for you. Investing allows you to put money into the stock market,
                mutual funds, bonds, real estate, an enterprise, etc. to receive profit on your investment through interest or other means.</p>
            <p>If investing sounds like something you want to pursue, we have 2 major tips for you to consider:</p>

            <h3 class="subheading">1. Invest Early</h3>
            <p>The longer you invest, the higher the return on your investment. This can be explained through the concept of compounding.</p>
            <i>How does compound interest benefit you over time?</i>
            <p>Compound interest allows you to earn interest on interest, which can help you gain more money. Let’s say, you invest an annual amount of $3000 into retirement savings from the age of 27. The growth rate of 12% and compound interest occurs
                for one time each year. By the retirement age of 65 years old, you would have $222,538.99 in your retirement money. On the contrary, if you started investing ten years after the age of 27, you would only earn $71,651.60 by the age of 65.
                That is a difference of $150,887.39 between 10 years more of compounding. Just imagine how much greater the final investment would be if you started investing at a younger age, as opposed to starting late. To calculate your compound interest,

            <i>When should I start investing?</i>
            <p>You should start investing as soon as you graduate university or college, especially when you have long-term goals, such as retirement.</p>

            <h3 class="subheading">2. Diversify</h3>
            <i>In the stock market</i>
            <p>Diversifying your investments, such as stock market shares, can mitigate risks while still providing adequate returns. For instance, if one of the companies you own a lot of shares of has gone bankrupt, you would lose quite a bit of money.
                However, if you have only 2 shares for that company while having 2 shares of a company that is thriving, the impact would be reduced.</p>
            <i>Diversifying your investments</i>
            <p>Some advice for diversifying include choosing assets that are distinctively different from each other. This means that their returns aren’t always parallel to each other and for stocks, they don’t necessarily lie in the same industry. A portfolio
                should comprise of a wide variety of different types of stocks, bonds, etc. that have distinguishing factors that ensure that even when a particular asset or company is suffering, you won’t be losing much money as the other investments
                will hopefully thrive in the other direction. This would cushion and balance the harm of the weak investment, from time to time.</p>
            <p>Additionally, it is recommended to choose to invest in different forms, from stocks, bonds, short-term investments, to cash. Even though diversifying does not guarantee the highest gains, it provides the strongest sense of stability and less
                volatility than placing your money into a single form of investment or stock.</p>

            <p>Investing is a worthwhile activity and it is essential to be mindful of what you invest in, while beginning at the age of 18 (or younger if investing with parental guidance). So start investing for #moremoneymoremoments!</p>
