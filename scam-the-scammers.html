            <p>Internet scammers will do anything to make a quick buck. Over the years, scams on the internet have become more and more abundant. In 2015, Canadians lost up to 15.6 million dollars from catphishing alone and over 6 million dollars in investments fraud. This is a major problem that can affect anyone who has access to the internet which includes us(Generation Z) a generation that is primarily focused on technology and social media. In order to prevent money loss it is essential to have what it takes to identify these types of internet scams and what to do to avoid getting tricked on the internet.</p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Catphishing</h3>
            <p>There are several different forms of internet scams that are used to trick young Canadians every day. One of the most popular internet scamming methods is catphishing. Catphishing is when internet scammers make fake profiles for the sole purpose of acquiring personal information of an individual on the internet. These profiles (which seem like they are coming from a legitimate company) are then used to send people emails in regards to offering services, prizes and other items in return for information. </p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Investment Fraud</h3>
            <p>Investment fraud is another major internet scam popular in Canada in 2015. Similar to catphishing, investment fraud occurs when an internet scammer offers someone a fake opportunity to invest in a fake special deal with an amazing rate of return with no risk. However, once this transaction is complete, no return rate is indeed returned to the consumer. This can result in a significant loss of money, even thought at first, seemed like an amazing chance to make some.</p>
            <h3 class="subheading">Scam the Scammer</h3>
            <p>Fortunately there are many ways to prevent getting fooled on the internet. Scammers will often pretend to be someone within your personal circle and someone you trust, whether it means pretending to be your parents or even your employer (if you work). When responding to a sudden and unexpected request from them, be sure to be careful whether it comes as a text, a phone call, or an email. Another way to prevent getting scammed is actually relatively simple, just do a quick Google search. Usually a quick search with keywords such as “scam”, “sale”, “review” and the company’s name or phone number can give you a quick rundown on whether they are known scammers. When unsure whether something is a scam, don’t be afraid to ask someone! Con-artists want you to make your decision as soon as possible as they are trying to prevent you from seeing through the lies. Don’t get caught up in their tricks and just slow down before making a decision. When subscribing for a free trial of a program/membership (especially online) be wary of the company and cancellation policy.</p>
            <p> Following these easy steps can prevent you from becoming a victim of the latest catphishing or financial fraud scam. The next time someone reaches out to you and asks for money, or offers a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity on the internet, make sure you are being extra careful towards making the best decision regarding you and your hard earned money. So next time you see those Yeezy raffles on Instagram, be careful about what info you give them!</p>
