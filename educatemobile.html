            <h4>Loans</h4> A loan is when any material, good, money, or land is exchanged to another party with a promise of future repayment. All loans are either secured or unsecured. Secured is when you put your personal property up as collateral, to gain the loan. If the loan is not paid back within the time period, then the property is taken. The interest rate is usually lower, as there is collateral. Unsecured loans do not have any form of backup, so the interest rate is determined by your income and credit history.

            <h4>OSAP</h4> It divides income into different tax brackets, each with their own progressively higher tax rate. The marginal tax rate for the tax bracket that your income level falls into does not determine your tax paid on all of your income. Income is taxed at the rate of the tax bracket that it falls into. For example: There are 2 tax brackets; $0-25,000 is taxed at 10% and $25,000 and above is taxed at 20%. If you earn $60,000, you do not pay 20% tax on that entire $60,000. You pay 10% on the first $25,000, equal to $2500.
            <br> Then, you pay 20% on all of the income above $60,000, equal to $7000. Therefore, the total tax you would pay on $60,000 in this case is $9500.
