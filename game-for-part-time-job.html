        <h4 style="font-weight:400; text-align: center; font-family:'Source Sans Pro',sans-serif;"> By Simon Lin </h4>
        <hr style="width:40%">
      <div style ="line-height:25px;">
        <p>Whether it be working at McDonalds, delivering newspapers or being a babysitter, a part time job provides you with tremendous value. During my first part time job at Pizza Nova, I was gaining experience and acquiring skills while getting paid at the same time. In addition, I was expanding my network, connecting with customers and coworkers. With an opportunity to earn income, gain experience, and to fill your resume, who wouldn’t take up this offer? No one. However, the search for part-time jobs is not always easy, so here are some tips for you:</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="font-weight:600">Craft a Well-Prepared Resume</h4>
<p>Preparing a resume may be obvious as all employers require you to submit one during the application process, but many applicants don’t know how to format or what to put in it. A resume should well be formatted and contain no spelling or grammar mistakes. Otherwise, you resume will represent you as someone who does not put care and effort into their work. <a href="https://cvmkr.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#34C15F">Here's</a> a great tool to help you create your professional resume in minutes.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="font-weight:600">Apply for Multiple Positions at Multiple Locations</h4>
<p>While finding a part time job may not be easy, you shouldn’t narrow yourself to a single location or to a single position. By limiting your applications,you are lowering the chance of getting a part time job. I suggest selecting a few positions that you would like to work as and apply to every location that’s convenient for you to travel to.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="font-weight:600">Prepare for the Interview </h4>
<p>Nothing sounds better than being well rehearsed! By preparing your responses in advanced, you will have no problem answering the general interview questions that are to be asked. Not only will this allow you to seem confident in your responses but it will also show that you know yourself. I recommend simulating an interview with a friend or family member in order to get an authentic experience before the scheduled interview.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="font-weight:600">Present Yourself with Respect</h4>
<p>First impressions always last and to be known as the person who came into the interview looking like a mess isn’t an impression you want! You should go into the interview with the best formal representation of yourself. I suggest to not wear anything flashy to the interview as the interview is about you and not about your flashy apparel.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="font-weight:600">Be on Time</h4>
<p>As mentioned above first impressions always last and you also don’t want to be the guy who showed up 10 minutes late for your interview. Not only does it shows that you weren't organized but it also shows that you're not as a reliable. As a general rule, you should be at least 10 minutes early for your interview. Although, I recommend to show up 30 minutes before so you can settle in and do any last-minute preparations.</p>
&nbsp;
<h4 style="font-weight:600">Follow Up</h4>
<p>Lastly, you should follow up with your interviewer after the interview with an email. This shows you that have interest in getting the job by putting in that extra effort. Despite so, if it contains any errors or shows anything negative about you it may affect your overall chances at the job.
&nbsp;
<p>With these tips, you'll have a great chance at getting a job offer. I know they helped me land one.</p>
