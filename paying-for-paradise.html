            <p>Travel can be a way to escape the burden of stress and to simply relax in the hotspot of your choice. However, stumbling blocks include the expenses of airplane tickets, accommodation, tours, and more. We are here to help with a few tips to
                keep in mind:</p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Saving up Money for your Moments</h3>
            <p>Before anything else, why not start a savings account just for your travel expenses? Even dedicating 10% of your monthly earnings or allowance can help you reach your dream destination much sooner. It can ensure that you do have enough money
                to have the best vacation, without scrambling last minute to fund the fees required. To find the best savings account for you, check out our savings account rankings <a href="http://intrst.ca/product-rankings.html" target="blank" style="color:#4acf72">here.</a></p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Automatic transfers</h3>
            <i>What is an automatic transfer?</i>
            <p>Before we get into the benefits you can receive from automatic transfers, it is important to know what it is. Automatic transfers allow you to transfer funds from one bank account to another in an instant. Transfers between the userâ€™s range
                of accounts would be accessible and done on regular intervals. </p>
            <i>How will it help me?</i>
            <p>Since they are frequently periodic for the most effectiveness, By simply using an automatic transfer for $5.00 per day into the savings for that much-coveted vacation, you have about $150 by the end of the month. This definitely quickens the
                time it takes to reach the amount of money needed to fund the trip. Just remember to periodically deposit a set amount from your chequing accounts for the purpose of travel, and you will reach this long-term goal as soon as possible. And
                since this process is automatic, it saves you time from having to withdraw and redeposit the money and restricts you from the urge to spend the money immediately.</p>

            <h3 class="subheading">Join Loyalty Programs and Redeem Points</h3>
            <i>Air Miles</i>
            <p>Joining a free loyalty program for an airline company would provide plenty of benefits. With just 1,125 points for a high-season flight from Ontario, you are able to get a free flight. Another way to earn air miles is from purchasing certain
                products from select companies. For instance, if you have a registered <a href="https://www.airmiles.ca/arrow/Home" target="blank" style="color:#4acf72">AIR MILES</a> card, $20 spent at the Metro supermarket equates to 1 reward mile. Other
                sponsored companies with similar money-mile conversions include Amazon, Apple, Sport Chek, Nike, Sears, Roots, etc. Check out our article on <a href="http://intrst.ca/learn-to-make-money-while-you-spend.html" target="blank" style="color:#4acf72">how to take advantage of loyalty programs</a>.
            </p>
            <i>Hotel Loyalty Programs</i>
            <p>Many hotels offer loyalty reward programs. For instance, a one-night stay in a regular room at the Sheraton Lake Buena Vista Resort in Florida would only require 3000 Starpoints from the Starwood Preferred Guest Program. Even though it may
                seem like it takes a lot of time, if you start saving now, you will be enjoying these rewards in the near future. </p>

            <p>Hopefully, these tips have given you a new perspective on how to quickly fund your vacation expenses, so start saving, transferring, and redeeming to whisk yourself away into paradise.</p>
